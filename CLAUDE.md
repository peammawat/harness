# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"          # install app + test deps into a venv
uvicorn app.main:app --reload    # run the API + chat UI at http://localhost:8000
pytest                           # run the full test suite
pytest tests/test_agent_loop.py::test_name -q   # run a single test
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up --build   # app + Searxng + Redis
```

Tests use fakes and `respx`-mocked HTTP, so no network access or API keys are needed.
There is no linter configured; match the existing style (`from __future__ import annotations`,
dataclasses, type hints, module docstrings).

## Configuration

All config is `app/config.py:Settings` (pydantic-settings), loaded from env / `.env`
(see `.env.example`). `get_settings()` is `lru_cache`d. A provider/backend whose key is
missing is silently skipped via `is_configured()` — the rest of the system keeps working.

## Auth

Two credential types, both resolved by `get_identity` (`app/api/deps.py`) into an
`AuthIdentity(username, role, kind)`, then surfaced through two dependencies that guard
every `/v1/*` route:
- **Web login** — **DB-backed** username/password accounts in the `users` table
  (`app/storage/user_store.py`), **seeded once** from `AUTH_USERS` (`user:pass,...`) on
  startup and managed thereafter via the admin panel. Passwords are PBKDF2-SHA256 hashes
  (stdlib, `app/api/passwords.py`). `POST /auth/login` (`app/api/routes/auth.py`) calls
  `authenticate()` (DB lookup, rejects `disabled`; falls back to `auth_user_map` for
  config-only users) and returns a **stateless HMAC session token** (`app/api/auth.py`:
  `create_token`/`verify_token`, signed with `token_secret` = `AUTH_SECRET` or fallback
  `API_KEYS`). The browser stores it and sends `Authorization: Bearer <token>`;
  `GET /auth/me` returns `{username, role}`.
- **Programmatic** — `X-API-Key` checked first against `API_KEYS` (comma-separated,
  server-wide, no DB row) and then against **per-user keys** in the `api_keys` table
  (`user_store.resolve_api_key`, matched by SHA-256 hash of the key — see
  `app/api/api_keys.py`). Either way the caller is role `user`; a per-user key is
  **attributed to its owner** (usage/quota count against that account) and is
  **rejected if the owner is disabled** (mirrors `resolve_token` for sessions).

Token validation is split: `verify_token` checks **signature + expiry only**;
`resolve_token` additionally confirms the user still exists and is **not disabled** (DB,
with config fallback), so disabling an account immediately invalidates its live tokens.
Session tokens carry no `k` claim — `verify_token` **rejects** any token that does, so a
purpose-scoped **password-reset token** (`create_reset_token`/`verify_reset_token`,
claim `k:"pwreset"`, short TTL) can never be replayed as a session token, or vice-versa.

- `require_auth` returns the **identity string** (`username` for tokens, the key for
  API-key auth) — unchanged contract, so routes and the storage layer are unaffected.
- `require_admin` returns the full `AuthIdentity` and 403s non-admins. Roles: a user's DB
  `role` (`admin`|`user`), defaulting to `admin` when the username is in `ADMIN_USERS`.

Either credential is accepted; auth returns 401/403 *before* the handler runs, so a bad
credential never reaches the LLM/search. `/auth/login`, `/v1/capabilities`, `/healthz`,
the public `/shared/*` links, and the static UI need no auth.

### Self-service account + password reset (`app/api/routes/me.py`, `routes/auth.py`)
- `/v1/me/*` (guarded by `require_auth`): a logged-in user manages **their own** account —
  `GET /v1/me` (profile incl. `email`), `PUT /v1/me/password` (verifies the current
  password), `PUT /v1/me/email` (regex-validated, uniqueness-checked), `PUT /v1/me/username`
  (a **true rename**), and `GET /v1/me/quota` (daily/monthly used vs. cap, for the UI
  progress bars; reuses `quota.resolve_limits` + `usage_since`). API-key callers have no DB
  row, so the mutating routes 400.
- **Personal API keys** — `GET/POST/DELETE /v1/me/api-keys`: a logged-in user generates,
  lists, and revokes their own keys. `POST` returns the full secret **once** (only the
  `key_prefix` is stored for later display); keys are SHA-256–hashed at rest. Used via the
  same `X-API-Key` header (see Auth → Programmatic). These routes require **web-login**
  auth (`_require_web_user` rejects `kind != "token"`), so a key can't be used to mint or
  revoke keys — that needs a session login.
- **Username rename** re-auths with the password, then `user_store.rename` →
  `conversation_store.rename_user` → `usage_store.rename_user` (each store re-keys its `user`
  column), and **returns a fresh session token** — the old token embeds the old name and
  stops resolving the instant the row is renamed.
- **Password reset (email)** — unauthenticated `POST /auth/forgot-password {email}` looks up
  the account (`user_store.get_by_email`) and emails a `?reset=<token>` link via
  `app/api/mailer.py` (stdlib `smtplib`, run off-thread; gated on `settings.smtp_configured`).
  It **always returns a generic 200** (no account enumeration) and is a no-op when SMTP is
  unset. `POST /auth/reset-password {token, new_password}` verifies the reset token and sets
  the new hash. SMTP + `APP_BASE_URL` + `PASSWORD_RESET_TTL_SECONDS` live in `Settings`.

### Admin panel + usage (`app/api/routes/admin.py`, `routes/usage.py`)
- `/v1/admin/*` (guarded by `require_admin`): user CRUD — list, create (409 on dup), reset
  password, set role, enable/disable, delete — plus `/usage` (per-user totals) and
  `/usage/recent`. **Lock-out guards** block deleting/disabling/demoting your own account
  or the last remaining admin.
- `/v1/usage/me` + `/usage/me/series` let any caller see their own token totals/trend.
- Admin UI lives in `web/` — an "Admin" view (shown only when `role === "admin"`, tracked
  via `localStorage["harness_role"]`) with the users + usage tables.

## Architecture

Two abstractions are the heart of the system. The agent loop is written against them, so
**adding a provider is one new file plus one registry line — no other code changes.**

### LLM providers (`app/llm/`)
- `base.py` defines `LLMProvider` (ABC) and the **normalized types**: `Message`, `ToolCall`,
  `ToolDef`, and streaming events `TextDelta | ToolUseRequest | TurnEnd`. Each provider's
  `stream_turn()` translates its SDK into these events so the agent loop is SDK-agnostic.
  `TurnEnd` also carries `input_tokens`/`output_tokens` (Anthropic `final.usage`; OpenAI via
  `stream_options.include_usage`), `0` when the server doesn't report them.
- `Message.raw` carries the provider's **native assistant content blocks verbatim** (e.g.
  Anthropic thinking blocks). The agent loop stores it and passes it back unchanged on the
  next turn so multi-step tool use round-trips correctly. It's only ever consumed by the
  provider that produced it (provider is fixed for the duration of a chat).
- `anthropic_provider.py` uses the official SDK with adaptive thinking + `effort: high`.
  `openai_provider.py` backs **two** registry entries: `openai` and `local` (the latter
  points the OpenAI client at `LOCAL_OPENAI_BASE_URL` for Ollama/vLLM/LM Studio).
- `registry.py:LLMRegistry` maps names → instances; `get()` raises if a provider is unknown
  or unconfigured.

### Search backends (`app/search/`)
- `base.py` defines `SearchProvider` (ABC) returning normalized `SearchResult`
  (`app/schemas.py`). Each backend has a class-level `name` and is constructed as
  `cls(client, settings)` (shared `httpx.AsyncClient` + settings), even for keyless ones
  like `duckduckgo`.
- `registry.py:SearchRegistry` lists backends in `_PROVIDER_CLASSES`, keyed by `cls.name`.
  Beyond `search()` it offers `aggregate()`, which fans out across configured backends
  concurrently and merges/dedupes by URL (a backend that errors is skipped, not fatal).

### Agent loop (`app/agent/loop.py`)
`run_agent()` is an async generator driving a provider through a tool-use loop and yielding
SSE-friendly dicts: `token`, `tool_call`, `tool_result`, `done`, `error`. The loop sums each
`TurnEnd`'s token counts and emits them on the final `done` event
(`input_tokens`/`output_tokens`); `routes/chat.py` records that to the usage store. Two tools
live in `tools.py`; `research_tools(search=, fetch=)` assembles the active set from request
flags:
- **`web_search`** — runs against the `SearchRegistry` (`enable_search`).
- **`fetch_url`** — fetches a page and returns readable text; available whenever search is on
  (so a pasted link is always readable) or in deep-research mode. Implemented in `fetch.py`,
  which is **SSRF-guarded** (`validate_url`: http(s) only, rejects private/loopback/link-local
  IPs, re-validated after redirects) and caps both downloaded bytes and returned characters.
  HTML → text uses a stdlib `html.parser` (`html_to_text`), no extra deps.

**Two modes**, both gated on the relevant markdown **skill** prepended as a system message
(`skills.py` loads from `agent/skills/`, stripping YAML frontmatter):
- Normal search: `web-search-researcher.md`, budget `MAX_ITERATIONS` (6).
- Deep research (`deep_research` flag): `deep-research.md`, budget `DEEP_RESEARCH_ITERATIONS`
  (16).
On the **final permitted turn** the loop withholds tools and injects a nudge so the model
answers from what it gathered instead of dead-ending on the iteration cap.

### Attachments (`app/agent/extract.py`, `routes/chat.py`)
Chat messages can carry inline base64 attachments (size-capped by `MAX_REQUEST_BYTES`):
- **Images** become `ImagePart`s passed to vision-capable providers (Anthropic always; the
  `local` provider only when `LOCAL_SUPPORTS_VISION`).
- **Documents** (PDF / docx / txt / md) are extracted to text in `_to_messages` and inlined
  into the message as a labelled fenced block. `extract_document_text` dispatches on media
  type then extension (`pypdf` / `python-docx` / UTF-8), truncates to `MAX_DOCUMENT_CHARS`,
  and **never raises** — a bad file yields a short Thai placeholder so it can't 500 the chat.

### Storage (`app/storage/`)
Three independent ABCs, each with a `Sqlite*` impl sharing the same shape (one shared
`aiosqlite` connection + an `asyncio.Lock`, `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` in `init()`;
single-node). All three live in the **one** SQLite file (`CHAT_DB_PATH` / `auth_db_path`).
Swapping any for Redis/Postgres = one new impl + the `lifespan` line.
- **`ConversationStore`** (`base.py` / `sqlite_store.py`) — chat history. Every method takes
  `user` (the identity `require_auth` returns), so **isolation is enforced at the storage
  layer**. Only message text (`role` + `content`) is persisted — inline attachments are not.
  Built in `lifespan` when `CHAT_HISTORY_ENABLED` (default on); `None` when disabled
  (`get_conversation_store`). `routes/chat.py` resolves/creates a conversation per request
  (continuing `conversation_id` only if owned by the caller) and persists the user message +
  assistant answer; streaming emits a leading `conversation` SSE event with the id.
  `routes/conversations.py` serves list/get/delete + share-link endpoints. `rename_user`
  re-keys a renamed user's conversations.
- **`UserStore`** (`user_store.py`) — the `users` table (username, PBKDF2 hash, role,
  disabled, created_at, per-user token limits, `email`). `seed()` is idempotent
  (`INSERT OR IGNORE` — re-seeding never overwrites a password changed in the panel). Built
  **unconditionally** in `lifespan` (DB auth works even when chat history is off) and seeded
  from `AUTH_USERS`/`ADMIN_USERS`. New columns (`email`, token limits) are added via additive
  `ALTER TABLE` migrations in `init()`. Beyond admin CRUD it exposes `set_email`,
  `get_by_email` (for forgot-password), and `rename` (refuses a name already taken). It also
  owns the `api_keys` table (personal keys: id, owner, SHA-256 `key_hash`, `key_prefix`,
  name, timestamps) via `create_api_key`/`list_api_keys`/`resolve_api_key`/`delete_api_key`;
  `rename` and `delete` **cascade** to it so a user's keys follow/are removed with the account.
- **`UsageStore`** (`usage_store.py`) — the `usage_events` table (one row per chat request),
  with `totals()`/`user_totals()`/`usage_since()`/`series()` (daily buckets)/`recent()`
  aggregations + `rename_user`. Recording is best-effort in `routes/chat.py` (a write failure
  never breaks a chat).

### API + app wiring (`app/api/`, `app/main.py`)
- `main.py` `lifespan` builds the shared `httpx.AsyncClient`, both registries, and the
  conversation/user/usage stores once and stores them on `app.state`; `api/deps.py` exposes
  them as FastAPI dependencies along with the `require_auth`/`require_admin` auth dependencies.
- Routes: `routes/auth.py` (`POST /auth/login`, `GET /auth/me`, `POST /auth/forgot-password`,
  `POST /auth/reset-password`), `routes/chat.py`
  (`POST /v1/chat`, SSE via `sse-starlette`, or single JSON when `stream=false`),
  `routes/search.py` (`POST /v1/search`, single or `aggregate`),
  `routes/conversations.py` (per-user chat history), `routes/me.py` (`/v1/me/*` self-service
  profile/password/email/username/quota, `require_auth`), `routes/admin.py` (`/v1/admin/*`
  user management + usage, `require_admin`), `routes/usage.py` (`/v1/usage/me`),
  `routes/health.py` (`GET /v1/capabilities` reports configured providers/backends, no auth).
  All `/v1/*` routes require `require_auth` (Bearer token or `X-API-Key`) except capabilities.
- The static chat UI in `web/` is mounted at `/` **last**, so `/v1/*` and `/docs` take
  precedence.

## Adding a provider/backend (the common change)

1. New file implementing the ABC (`stream_turn` + `is_configured`, or `search` + `is_configured`),
   with a unique `name`.
2. Register it: add to `LLMRegistry._providers` or `SearchRegistry._PROVIDER_CLASSES`.
3. Add any needed key to `Settings` and `.env.example`.
The agent loop, API, and schemas do not change.
